    tournament.py -- implementation of a Swiss-system tournament.

    A database that tracks players and matches in game tournaments.
    Program uses the Swiss-system for pairing players in each round in a
    tournament. Multiple tournaments are supported and players can enter
    multiple tournaments. The database returns players' ranking/standing
    based on wins. In the event that multiple players have the same
    number of wins, ranking is calculated by the Opponent Match Wins.

    API Overview:
        delete_matches(): removes matches from data
        delete_players(): removes players from data
        count_players(tournament_id): counts # of players in given
        tournament
        register_player(name): registers player
        player_standings(tournament_id):  returns the current standings
        report_match(winner, loser, tournament_id): report match results
        swiss_pairings(tournament_id): calculates appropriate match
        pairings


    Quick Start:
        -   Add players into database with register_player() function.
            Function takes string text as a parameter.
        -   Archive match results by reporting them with report_match().
            report_match() takes in winner id and loser id
            (respectively). Optionally, it takes in the tournament id.
        -   swiss_pairings() function will calculate the next pair of
            matchups that satisfies the Swiss-system property.

    To Do -- Future Implementations:
        1)  Maybe just add another table: player's wins, loses -- this
            will make the player_standings() function a lot easier.
        2)  Add features: support for odd-number players; support ties
            as a match result.
        3)  Since matches table is dependant on players table, we could
            call delete_matches() inside delete_players()
